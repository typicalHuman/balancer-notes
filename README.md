This is a repository of my notes on the [Balancer Protocol](https://docs.balancer.fi/). I'm just trying to dig deeper into the logic and analyze it from a technical POV. These notes are organized in a way that is handy for me and also the notes might not be 100% true, because I'm still learning and reading the code, full understanding of the protocol is not the easiest task, so I might be wrong, if you find some bugs or just have some fixes and suggestions - feel free to create a new issue or DM me.
In the future I may add some code to demonstrate some concepts or write some tutorials.

P.S. I'm using Obsidian.
