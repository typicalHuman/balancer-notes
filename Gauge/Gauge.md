"A gauge doesn’t balance the weights of the pool, that is the role of the specific pool type / AMM / swap logic the pool uses.

In simple terms, a ‘Gauge’ is a contract that allows for streaming BAL emissions to a Liquidity Pool. Pools do not automatically have a gauge, they must be approved via governance. This means that for any liquidity pool to receive BAL incentives, external protocols/DAOs must propose a gauge and Balancer Governance must approve. So, how do pools receive BAL incentives? That comes down to the Gauge Vote. The Gauge ‘Vote’ system has become an industry-wide standard for Decentralised Exchanges, allowing governance token holders of the protocol (veBAL for Balancer) to vote and dictate which LPs the DEX’s native token emissions flow to. The distribution and direction of BAL are decided on a weekly cadence by this vote."
