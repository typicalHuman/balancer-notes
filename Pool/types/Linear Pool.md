Basically [ERC4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) liquidity pool with 1 ERC20 token and 1 underlying token. Usually used in [[Boosted Pool]]s.

"One additional critical feature of Linear Pools is that they allow users to trade directly to BPT; no joins or exits are needed."
NOTE: not sure what that means, need to check the code.
